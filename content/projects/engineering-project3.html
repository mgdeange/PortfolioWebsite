  <h2 class="category-title">Abstract</h2>
  <p>The team designed and built a system to automate the visual inspection and verification process of hazardous
    materials. This was part of the Devil's Invent Hackathon, a 3-day hacktathon sponsored by Los Alamos National
    Laboratories.</p>

  <p>I served a more supportive role in this group, providing consistent assistance between various aspects of the
    fabrication and integration process. I also developed the presentation that we presented on the final day of the
    hackathon, which you can see <a

    The Problem
  </h2>
  <p>As part of the hackathon, one of the real-world problems they were looking for solutions for was for automating
    hazardous materials in the material disposal process. The full problem is the following: </p>

    The Solution
  </h2>
  <p>
    While Los Alamos did say they wanted an automated solution, the team wanted to make sure that the operator was not
    completely removed from the equation. The focus was then on applying the operator in a way that they could be safer
    while still having an important job. The chosen concept was to create a system where the material would be handled
    by a robot arm and placed
    onto a roundtable that could be manually controlled by the operator so they could visually inspect the material
    without having to touch it themselves. The operator could then use an HMI to either approve or deny the material.
  </p>

  <p>In the case of denial, the robot arm would send the material back for further production and future approval. </p>

  <p>In the case of approval, the robot arm would take the material and place it gently into a barrel.
