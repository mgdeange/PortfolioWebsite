    <p>
      The team designed and built a mobile weather station that continously
      transmits data to a WiFi server for a user to read from, and allow the
      user to control from that server. I was in charge of the PCB design, code,
      and documentation for the project, which you can find

    <h2 class="category-title">The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      The mission of the team is to create a sensor-based weather-reporting
      product that is unique, portable, professional, reliable, and
      user-friendly. It is something that should be focused so that a person can
      easily use and install themselves and is relatively simple to collect data
      from, along with contingency plans in case things go awry.
    </p>

    <h2 class="category-title">The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to plant caretaking, some plants require more than just
      watering them every now and again Some require a more robust maintenance
      schedule, which can interefere with people's working schedules. The
      project seeks to offset that by creating a device that can autonomously
      care for a plant based on certain factors, such as humidity of the soil or
      the temperature of the surrounding area, and signal to the user how the
      plant is doing wherever they are.
    </p>

    <h2 class="category-title">Design Features</h2>
    <p>
      The mobile weather station consists of a belt-based movement system that
      the plant would be placed on, and move to and from a shaded area in
      accordance to certain variables, such as humidity and temperature.

    <div class="button-container">
      <button class="expand-button collapsed" data-id="1">
        Mobile
        <span class="text">
          The station is built for smaller plants, and thus is easy for the user
          to place wherever they want.
        </span>
      </button>

      <button class="expand-button collapsed" data-id="2">
        Temperature
        <span class="text">
          The temperature sensor built into the station detects if the area is
          too hot or too cold for the plant, and will move to the shade to
          protect it accordingly.
        </span>
      </button>

      <button class="expand-button collapsed" data-id="3">
        Humidity
        <span class="text">
          The humidity sensor would detect if the soil needs to be watered or
          not, and will move the plant outside of the shade for the user to
          water.
        </span>
      </button>

      <button class="expand-button collapsed" data-id="4">
        WiFi
        <span class="text">
          The system continuously transmits data to an MQTT server, where the
          user can see the current state of the plant. The user can also
          manually send the plant either in or out of the shade by sending a
          signal from the MQTT server.
        </span>
      </button>
