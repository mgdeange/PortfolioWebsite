              The team's goal was to design and build a mobile weather station
              that could transmit and receive data to and from an MQTT server,
              using microcontroller-to-microcontroller communication and serial
              communication. The team took that concept and applied it to a
              plant caretaker system, which would autonomously move a plant in
              and out of shaded housing according to temperature and humidity
              data.

            The Problem
          </h2>
          <div class="content-box-body">
            <p>
              The mission of the team is to create a sensor-based
              weather-reporting product that is unique, portable, professional,
              reliable, and user-friendly. It is something that should be
              focused so that a person can easily use and install themselves and
              is relatively simple to collect data from, along with contingency
              plans in case things go awry.

            The Solution
          </h2>
          <div class="content-box-body">
            <p>
              When it comes to plant caretaking, some plants require more than
              just watering them every now and again Some require a more robust
              maintenance schedule, which can interfere with people's working
              schedules. The project seeks to offset that by creating a device
              that can autonomously care for a plant based on certain factors,
              such as humidity of the soil or the temperature of the surrounding
              area, and signal to the user how the plant is doing wherever they
              are.

          </h2>
          <div class="content-box-body">
            <p>
              The mobile weather station consists of a belt-based movement
              system that the plant would be placed on, and move to and from a
              shaded area in accordance to certain variables, such as humidity
              and temperature.

            Mobile
            <span class="text">
              The station is built for smaller plants, and thus is easy for the
              user to place wherever they want.
            </span>
          </button>

          <button class="expand-button collapsed" data-id="2">
            Temperature
            <span class="text">
              The temperature sensor built into the station detects if the area
              is too hot or too cold for the plant, and will move to the shade
              to protect it accordingly.
            </span>
          </button>

          <button class="expand-button collapsed" data-id="3">
            Humidity
            <span class="text">
              The humidity sensor would detect if the soil needs to be watered
              or not, and will move the plant outside of the shade for the user
              to water.

            WiFi

              The system continuously transmits data to an MQTT server, where
              the user can see the current state of the plant. The user can also
              manually send the plant either in or out of the shade by sending a
              signal from the MQTT server.

    <h2 class="category-title">Lessons Learned</h2>
    <div class="title-line"></div>

    <p>
      This project was eye-opening in a lot of ways. It gave me the opportunity
      to learn how to work extensively in a group where communication was
      critical in ways I hadn't experienced in other project courses before,
      given that everyone's subsystems had to not only function, but function
      with other systems at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning how to integrate microcontroller-to-microcontroller communication
      using two different languages was also novel to me, but it made a lot of
      sense the more I understood the process. Learning how to transmit and
      receive serial data using an MQTT server, and being able to visually see
      my inputs creating a reaction in the system, was a very rewarding process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developing the board was definitely a process, as WiFi communication can
      be sensitive even on the best of days, so learning the importance of
      keeping 'messier' systems like the power supply as far away as possible
      from anything that needed to transmit or receive data was critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, it opened my eyes to how fun it is to document the engineering
      process and develop it for public showing on a website. It made me really
      appreciate web design and how it wasn't as imposing as I thought it was.
      While I look back on the website now and can see parts that I could do
      better, I'm still happy with how it turned out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this project kickstarted a lot of different interests in me and
      for that I'll always look back on it fondly, even if it was an incredibly
      unforgiving project.
