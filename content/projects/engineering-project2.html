  <h2 class="category-title">Abstract</h2>
  <p>The team designed and built a mobile weather station that continously transmits data to a WiFi server for a user to
    read from, and allow the user to control from that server.
    I was in charge of the PCB design, code, and documentation for the project, which you can find <a
      href="https://team207-s2024.github.io/team207-s2024/" target="_blank">here.</a>

    The Problem
  </h2>
  <p>
    The mission of the team is to create a sensor-based weather-reporting product that is unique, portable,
    professional, reliable, and user-friendly. It is something that should be focused so that a person can easily use
    and install themselves and is relatively simple to collect data from, along with contingency plans in case things go
    awry.
  </p>

  <h2 class="category-title">
    The Solution
  </h2>
  <p>When it comes to plant caretaking, some plants require more than just watering them every now and again
    Some require a more robust maintenance schedule, which can interefere with people's working schedules.
    The project seeks to offset that by creating a device that can autonomously care for a plant based on certain
    factors, such as humidity of the soil or the temperature of the surrounding area, and signal to the user
    how the plant is doing wherever they are.
  </p>

  <h2 class="category-title">Design Features</h2>
  <p>The mobile weather station consists of a belt-based movement system that the plant would be placed on, and move to
    and from a shaded area in accordance to certain variables, such as humidity and temperature.</p>

    <button class="expand-button collapsed" data-id="1">
      Mobile
      <div class="text">The station is built for smaller plants, and thus is easy for the user to place wherever they
        want.</div>
    </button>

    <button class="expand-button collapsed" data-id="2">
      Temperature
      <div class="text">The temperature sensor built into the station detects if the area is too hot or too cold for the
        plant, and will move to the shade to protect it accordingly.</div>
    </button>

    <button class="expand-button collapsed" data-id="3">
      Humidity
      <div class="text">The humidity sensor would detect if the soil needs to be watered or not, and will move the plant
        outside of the shade for the user to water.</div>
    </button>

    <button class="expand-button collapsed" data-id="4">
      WiFi
      <div class="text">The system continuously transmits data to an MQTT server, where the user can see the current
        state of the plant. The user can also manually send the plant either in or out of the shade by sending a signal
        from the MQTT server.</div>
