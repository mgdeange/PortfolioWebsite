  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Huh. I'm not really sure how you got here, but kudos to you. This is just a page to wax a little bit about myself and how I got to where I'm at. </p>
  <p>I'm born in raised in Arizona, but I'm definitely considering spreading my wings somewhere else. The heat's getting a bit crazy, and a new environment would do me some good. </p>
  <p>Some of my hobbies include drawing, character design, and video games. I also enjoy playing DnD with my friends when all our schedules align, which has gotten harder and harder as we've gotten older.
  Generally, I'm always up to try new things. Even when it doesn't work out, it always feels fulfilling to have at least gone for it.</p>
  <h2>Why Engineering?</h2>
  <p>I consider engineering to be a skillset, a set of tools for me to use for things I want to make. It allows the things that I create to have a logical backing, whether it be for things related to STEM or not.
  By pursuing an engineering degree, I've learned a lot of technical skills that I wouldn't have otherwise pursued if I went into something like art, and I don't regret it for a second. </p>
